to build the SST docs:

- install sphinx ($sudo apt-get install python-sphinx)
- run 'make_rst.py', which will produce the .rst docs
- go up to the main sst directory and run: $ sphinx-build -b html docs sst_docs

this will produce HTML documentation in the sst_docs directory. Open
index.html with your browser.

(Note that `python-sphinx` will only work with Ubuntu Natty. For
Maverick or earlier you will need a more recent version of Sphinx.
The easiest way to do this is to create a virtualenv and install
Sphinx into that.)
