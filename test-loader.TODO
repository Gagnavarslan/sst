* run all tests

  sst test

* run acceptance tests

  sst test -s tests.acceptance

* run unit tests

  sst test -x tests.acceptance

* provide simple helpers for the most common cases:

This will probably trigger a refactor around:
- whether dir file loaders need to be passed to discoverTests*,

** ignore this tree

** sst scripts here

** importable tests here

* some test_loader tests are too big, this screams for better helpers so
   they can be simplified.

* fix the remaining grey areas in the design

There are a few points that smell funny in the current implementation
including:

- abusing sortTestMethodsUsing

- having to call sortNames in several places

This is probably caused by some less than ideal split of responsability
between TestLoader and the {File|Dir}Loader classes.

The key points that need to be handled are:

- whether directories are packages or not and as such require to be imported

- if they are imported, respect user overriding

- allowing the user to specify some matching on the base names encountered
   while walking the tree (or a sub tree). This should remain separate for
   files and directories (the rules are different).

- how the sub tree is iterated
