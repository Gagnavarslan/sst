* run all tests

  sst test

* run acceptance tests

  sst test -s tests.acceptance

* run unit tests

  sst test -x tests.acceptance

* sort all names during loading, all tests after (by id)

* Unify dir and file loader ? Single place to match

* match by either basename or path

* scan the test id until it's not a python identifier to prune during
   loading

* provide simple helpers for the most common cases:

This will probably trigger a refactor around:
- whether dir and file loaders should be unified,
- whether dif file loaders need to be passed to discoverTests*,
- tests should be sorted by ids (for the test files, classes and methods),
- whether filtering should be applied to base names, paths or both.

** ignore this tree

** sst scripts here

** importable tests here

* some test_loader tests are too big, this screams for betetr helpers so
   they can be simplified.
