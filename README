---------------------------------
    Automated Testing with Python
---------------------------------

SST (selenium-simple-test) is a web test framework that uses Python
to generate functional browser-based tests.

Tests are made up of scripts or test case classes, created by composing
actions that drive a browser and assert conditions. You have the flexibilty
of the full Python language, along with a convenient set of functions to
simplify web testing.

SST consists of:

 * user actions and assertions (API) in Python
 * test case loader (generates/compiles scripts to unittest cases)
 * console test runner
 * concurrent/parallel tests
 * data parameterization/injection
 * selectable output reports
 * selectable browsers
 * headless (xvfb) mode
 * screenshots on errors

Test output is displayed to the console and optionally saved as 
JUnit-compatible XML for compatibility with CI systems.
